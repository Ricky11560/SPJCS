<p> It has come to the notice of the Management that some Parents now feel lacadesical in Paying their Wards/Children school fees.
    This attitude cause grave pontential danger in administrating the school because these are all source of funds for running 
    the school and paying staffs.<br> The Management has come to the conclusion that all school fees must be paid on-time before the 
    end of the second month of resumption as their Wards would be sent home in failure to comply.</p>
